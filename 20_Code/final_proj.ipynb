    "## Motivation\n",
    "- We are interested in the MBTI personality test because it is trending recently. There are websites showing us people's personaility types and we want to know if that validates in real life to classify people in these 16 types and how people's MBTI type is related to the posts that they have posted online. When we meet new people, we always ask someone's MBTI type on the first day and that's very interesting to see if there's only common patterns among the people with the same MBTI types. Currently, there are a lot of social apps taking MBTI as an option of input of personal information. We did some research and found out that the dating app such as `Coffee Meets Bagel` has an option to put user's MBTI type, which potentially can be a predictor of choosing the other users. Beyond sakes of socialize, it can be useful in finding the right track for personal growth. Beibei has taken a required course in high school called CornerStone and this is a class to help students find their career path. And MYers & Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI) was being adopted in this class. With the wide-spread usage of MBTI personality test, we want to take this as our project to answer our interested research questions in the `Research Question` portion.\n"

    "- Myers and her mother Briggs developed a system to distingusih people's personalities by 16 types and it's orgianlly based on their subjective data collection.\n",
    "- Additionally, there are a lot of controversies/bias in this personality indicator test. Based on the [1], the creation of this personality exam is based on the common trend or consistent preference appeared in Isabel Myers and her mother Katharine Cook Briggs's(They are the two developers of the MBTI personality test) relatvies and friends, and the sample size is only about 20. Thus it can't be statistically significant to design a test in this way. Larger samples are taken later for the validity of the design of the test. It is not heaviily relied on theories in psychology.\n",
