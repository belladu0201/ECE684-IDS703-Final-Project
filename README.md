# ECE684-IDS703-Final-Project
NLP Final Project FA22

# Team Members
There are three people in the group: Xiaoyu Chen, Beibei Du, Xianchi Zhang.

# Motivation
We are interested in the well-known personality test: MBTI, which stands for Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator. Although there are some bias toward this personality test, we want to use Natural Language Processing knowledge to see if the prediction is significant. 

# Introduction
There are in total of 16 personalities based on the MBTI.
[Describe the MBTI test from research paper by the end of 11/23].

# Research Question
1. Do the extroverted people have less posts tha introverted people?
2. [TBD]

# Data
We decided to use the data from Kaggle: [MBTI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type).

In this dataset, we have 8675 observations and 2 columns. The two columns are `type` and `posts`.
# Tools
We will use the language of Python for this project. The relevant tools include: Git, Github, EDA(matplotlib, seaborn, altair, pandas), NLP(TBD), Report(Overleaf(latex), Google slides).

# Approaches (Algorithms)

1. We can use language modeling to predict the category of personality based on the words that distingusih the most from the other categories.
