NLP Final Project FA22

# Team Members
There are three people in the group: Xiaoyu Chen, Beibei Du, Chixuan Zhang.

# Motivation
We are interested in the well-known personality test: MBTI, which stands for Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator. Although there are some bias toward this personality test, we want to use Natural Language Processing knowledge to see if the prediction is significant.
